# weather-app
A simple and responsive weather application built using React. This app allows users to search for any city and view real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and location coordinates. The data is fetched using the OpenWeatherMap API, and dynamic weather icons are displayed based on the current conditions.
